# ðŸ’Œ hey stranger,

As I'm sure you're well aware, you've entered an app in its alpha/beta phase of testing and development, which means the place is essentially one big construction zone. (You can read the [changelog](https://catalog.fyi/changelog) for details.) Watch your head!

There are a few things that are good for you to know about the app, and its current and future state.

# getting started

1. Fill out whatever you want to on your profile, like name/bio, favorite books, and current status.

2. You can find some people to follow if you want to, by going to the [homepage](https://catalog.fyi/home) and browsing some of the recent activity in the sections there.

3. Add a few books to your shelves (e.g. currently reading, up next) by going to the book's page and clicking "shelves".

4. Create a list or two if you want to. People have been making lists like "favorites of 2023," "to read in 2024," or lists of books around specific topics that they want to share or remember.

5. Explore other people's stuff, continue to keep track of your books and recs as you read, and try out some of the other features that are there now, and more that will be releasing soon. If you love it and want to get your friends in too, you can point them to the [waitlist signup](https://tally.so/r/mZ20aA).

You can find a bit more context about the app in our blog archive, specifically my post [a space for book people](https://catalog.fyi/news/catalog-news-004-a-space-for-book-people).

If you have any questions or run into any issues, let us know. We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Htj7gWYCkC) for feedback, or you can email staff@catalog.fyi or use the "feedback" link in the user menu (top right).

# tips

**Shelves vs. lists:**
You don't need to create lists like "currently reading" or "to read", as you can use shelves for that, which include: **to read**, **up next**, **currently reading**, **read**, and **abandoned**. Shelves are a little different from lists in that everyone has the same set of shelves, they show up differently on your profile, and eventually they can have different privacy settings from your lists (for example, if you want private reading-tracking but public curation). At the moment, you can shelve a book by going to the book's page and clicking "shelves" (the bookmark icon), but we will be adding more convenient ways to shelve a book from anywhere, as well as more convenient ways to move a book from one shelf to the next. (You may find you prefer to use lists for everything anyway, which is totally fine!)

**Read dates and reading history:**
If you add read dates to a book at any point (go to the book's page, click "add note or log"), they won't show up anywhere right now, but they'll be recorded and eventually we will be able to show them in a timeline of your reading history. So in the meantime, you can certainly create lists like "read in 2024" as many people have been doing, but just know that you can also use read dates instead of or in addition to lists, when it comes to tracking _when_ you read a book. To log a reread for a book that already has a finished date or that has been marked read, just add a new log with a new set of dates.

# book search and book details

For our book search, and for all the book details you see, including titles, author names, descriptions, and covers, we use [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/) as our data source. We choose to work with them because of a deep alignment of values, because we believe that book _metadata_ (the aforementioned details) should be free and open. That means we forgo paying for the kind of proprietary book data that powers some other book apps. That data is often supplied by huge companies who employ lots of people whose job it is to clean and fix book data; meanwhile, OpenLibrary relies on a small fleet of volunteer librarians who are just passionate about books.

As such, you can expect to see lots of imperfections and weird things in the search results and book details: wonky capitalization, missing descriptions or covers, descriptions that are randomly in another language, cover images that are just a photo of an actual book, and more! Oh, and everything is a little wonkier for books whose original language is not English.

But take heart: we will soon let you edit book details, and add/change cover images, so that you can fix whatever bothers you. And we hope that there will be books for which you find it worthwhile to do so. (See the note about OpenLibrary near the bottom of this page, for more on why you might do so.)

In the meantime, one tangible thing you can do to help: when you search for a book and get duplicate results (multiple results that all seem more or less correct), try to choose the "best" record (often the one with the most editions, or that has a cover image or the most filled-out details) as the one you interact with. Sometimes it's really not clear which one is the "best" record, and that's okay! But our system is set up to "learn" which book results are the best based on which ones you interact with (i.e., add to your lists/shelves or write notes about, etc), so you can help us filter for the best results just by paying extra attention to this as you use catalog.

# bugs and errors

There will be bugs and errors. So don't be alarmed if you run into one! Just screenshot it and send it to us, via Discord, email, text message, or any way that you normally talk to us. In fact, you should be proud to discover a new bug, and we will certainly appreciate it.

# privacy

For now, everything you can see around the app, including your profile, lists, shelves, and notes, are public and open to the wider internet. This means everything is shareable even with people who aren't on catalog, but also that if you don't want your profile tied to your identity, you might want to use a pseudonym.

We will be adding privacy settings before too long, so that you'll have more control over these things.

# invites

For now, we are inviting each person personally, though we have a [waitlist](https://tally.so/r/mZ20aA) that people can add themselves to. But if there are a couple of folks you want to invite whose presence around catalog would make a huge difference for you, please let us know! We'll put them at the top of the list for the next round of invites.

Later on, we'll give you the ability to invite friends yourself, and later still, we'll hopefully open up to the public.

# other features

Most of the features you see in the app now are a mere barest-bones shadow of what they will eventually be. If some features seem oddly or illogically incomplete, that's usually the reason why: it's on our to-do list, but we haven't gotten to it yet. We will be shipping new features and improvements all the time. Still, if there's a feature you'd like to see, do speak up! There's a lot we haven't thought of, and we're always looking for more ideas.

# how to be a ðŸŒŸ beta tester

Mostly we just want you to have fun with catalog and tell us what you think. But if you want to go the extra mile, here are a few ways to be a superstar tester:

Report any bugs, issues you run into, and general weird or unexpected things. You can reach us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/Htj7gWYCkC), email (staff@catalog.fyi), or any other way that you normally talk to us. There is also a "feedback" link (from the user menu, top right) where you can submit your feedback.

Make suggestions for things you'd like to see in catalog, or for how you'd want things to work differently. Your involvement at this early stage will have an outsize influence on how catalog evolves.

Add links to books you're reading or thinking about (via "add a link" on the book's page), as you run into them in your day-to-day, whether they're reviews, interviews, podcasts, TikToks, events, or something else. This will help build a rich context around each book of related media and conversation to explore.

Whenever you're mentioning a book in a digital conversation, consider sharing the catalog.fyi book link instead of the Amazon link! For more of our thoughts on the topic of book links and their implications, you can read our newsletter post on it [here](https://catalog.fyi/news/catalog-news-003-the-book-link).

(Eventually, when we've enabled this) Help us improve our books by adding and fixing book details and covers on books you care about. Particularly once we've worked out a way to sync our book data and edits back to OpenLibrary, your contributions here could affect _millions_ of people around the world.

love,
rory & glenn
