Elif Batuman,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,"Help Wanted is like a great nineteenth-century novel about now, at once an effervescent workplace comedy and a profoundly human exploration of the psychic toll exacted by the labor market. The characters are so richly drawn—so full, under all their defenses, of the desire to be loved—that even the annoying ones will win your heart. Adelle Waldman is a master.",
Joshua Ferris,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,"In Help Wanted, the tragic heroes of the gig economy, full of dreams and sob stories and what-if scenarios, concoct a plot to better their lives. Yet even as frustrations mount and their plot goes sideways, hope never dies. Adelle Waldman delivers both a brilliant diagnosis and a moving account of retail workers hidden in plain sight all around us, whose full humanity has never been so richly displayed or touchingly rendered.",
Keith Gessen,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,"A serious moral inquiry into the lives of a group of people who work in a big-box store, Help Wanted is a novel about work, about the retail industry in the age of Amazon, and about the effects of late capitalism on human relations. It is also hard to put down.",
Michelle Orange,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,What a gorgeous and ingenious and heartfelt work Help Wanted is!,
Gary Shteyngart,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,I can’t think of a book more necessary. Adelle Waldman takes us into the universe of American labor with generosity and compassion. It has been a while since workers have been portrayed through the lens of a novelist with such insight and attention to the details of service industry life. Simply enthralling.,
Richard Russo,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,"Help Wanted isn’t just smart and funny and wise. It’s also important—vital, really—to our understanding of how and why the American dream is becoming increasingly inaccessible to working class Americans, even as that long-shot dream stubbornly refuses to die.",
Charles Bock,,Recommender,,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,Blurb,,,"Help Wanted is a marvelous novel. We get to eavesdrop and follow and enjoy the misadventures of the motley cast working the four in the morning shift (unloading trucks at a big box store, a place none of these workers can afford). On one level this is about economics and gentrification; on another level it is about people struggling to keep themselves from drowning; meanwhile there are hijinks so funny you blow your tea out of your nose; there’s a perfectly absurd plot straight out of Catch-22. We want everyone to get that lifesaving promotion. The worst thing about this novel is that I finished it and can’t ever read it again for the first time. But now it is part of my life. I am thankful to Adelle Waldman for being brave and talented and bighearted enough to have created this gift.",

Carolyn Burke,,Recommender,Blurb,Kiki Man Ray,Mark Braude,OL25338027W,https://catalog.fyi/books/kiki-man-ray-mark-braude,,Reviews & Endorsements,https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324006015/about-the-book/reviews,"Kiki Man Ray is a thoroughly researched and gracefully written life of the (until now) underestimated model, performer, painter, actress, and influencer known as Kiki de Montparnasse.  Mark Braude’s biography brings her out of the wings and sets her firmly center stage in this evocative portrait of artistic life in the Paris of the 1920s.",
Elif Batuman,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,"Help Wanted is like a great nineteenth-century novel about now, at once an effervescent workplace comedy and a profoundly human exploration of the psychic toll exacted by the labor market. The characters are so richly drawn—so full, under all their defenses, of the desire to be loved—that even the annoying ones will win your heart. Adelle Waldman is a master.",
Joshua Ferris,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,"In Help Wanted, the tragic heroes of the gig economy, full of dreams and sob stories and what-if scenarios, concoct a plot to better their lives. Yet even as frustrations mount and their plot goes sideways, hope never dies. Adelle Waldman delivers both a brilliant diagnosis and a moving account of retail workers hidden in plain sight all around us, whose full humanity has never been so richly displayed or touchingly rendered.",
Keith Gessen,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,"A serious moral inquiry into the lives of a group of people who work in a big-box store, Help Wanted is a novel about work, about the retail industry in the age of Amazon, and about the effects of late capitalism on human relations. It is also hard to put down.",
Michelle Orange,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,What a gorgeous and ingenious and heartfelt work Help Wanted is!,
Gary Shteyngart,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,I can’t think of a book more necessary. Adelle Waldman takes us into the universe of American labor with generosity and compassion. It has been a while since workers have been portrayed through the lens of a novelist with such insight and attention to the details of service industry life. Simply enthralling.,
Richard Russo,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,"Help Wanted isn’t just smart and funny and wise. It’s also important—vital, really—to our understanding of how and why the American dream is becoming increasingly inaccessible to working class Americans, even as that long-shot dream stubbornly refuses to die.",
Charles Bock,,Recommender,Blurb,Help Wanted,Adelle Waldman,OL37578659W,,,,,"Help Wanted is a marvelous novel. We get to eavesdrop and follow and enjoy the misadventures of the motley cast working the four in the morning shift (unloading trucks at a big box store, a place none of these workers can afford). On one level this is about economics and gentrification; on another level it is about people struggling to keep themselves from drowning; meanwhile there are hijinks so funny you blow your tea out of your nose; there’s a perfectly absurd plot straight out of Catch-22. We want everyone to get that lifesaving promotion. The worst thing about this novel is that I finished it and can’t ever read it again for the first time. But now it is part of my life. I am thankful to Adelle Waldman for being brave and talented and bighearted enough to have created this gift.",
