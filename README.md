[catalog](https://catalog.fyi) is a space for book people. We imagine a space that will help the book community to take care of itself online, to curate what matters, and to contribute to the collective knowledge of books and our relationships with them. We've built a social network on top of the Open Library and are working to integrate with an ecosystem of builders and projects that share our care for user agency and open data (e.g. Internet Archive, Wikipedia, ActivityPub, AT Protocol, etc.). We hope to serve as a cozy bookish corner of the open social web as it develops.

## Contributing

If you want to **contribute financially** to help with hosting and maintenance costs, you can do so over at our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/catalog).

If you're interested in **contributing to the codebase:** As the codebase is maintained by a tiny team of part-time volunteers, we aren't equipped to respond to unsolicited issues or PRs. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/BWTSEkDT9W) and talk to Rory if you have something in mind that you'd like to help with or work on, or if you've found a bug or security vulnerability.
